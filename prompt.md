Update the prompt to instruct creation of a JS file with a basic function and a corresponding test file.

When editing existing files, avoid repeating existing code. Instead, use a line comment with `// ...existing code...` to represent regions of unchanged code.  
The code block for each file being edited must start with a comment containing the filepath.  
For existing files, make sure the filepath exactly matches the filepath of the original file.  
When suggesting to create new files, pick a location inside `c:\Users\colmk\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\prompts`.
